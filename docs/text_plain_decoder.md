# The Text-Plain Decoder

This payload decoder is useful for simple ASCII payloads. The decoder will try to interpret the payload as a floating point number, an integer or a string. The Text-Plain Decoder is currently only functional with 'async' sampling mode. Refer to the examples found [here](config.md).
