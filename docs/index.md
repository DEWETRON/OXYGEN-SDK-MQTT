The OXYGEN measurement software is the most intuitive and easy-to-use software in the data acquisition sector, designed to be operated via touchscreen or classical mouse and keyboard. Its nice instruments and controls make it fun to navigate through tons of data. Made by DEWETRON. The MQTT Plugin allows OXYGEN to subscribe to data and publish channels using the MQTT protocol.
