# The CBOR-Sync Protocol

Currently, this is the only payload decoder which supports sending a stream of packets containing samples to OXYGEN using MQTT. Hence, setting `sampling` to `sync` is mandatory. An example on how to configure can be found [here](config.md).


Currently, this protocol is part of an ongoing research project at [KAI](https://www.k-ai.at/).
If you have further questions, feel free to contact the project maintainers.
