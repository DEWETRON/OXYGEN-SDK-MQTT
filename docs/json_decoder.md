# The JSON Decoder

This decoder interprets an ASCII string payload as JSON object. A JSON Object can contain multiple OXYGEN channels. The decoder will interpret each channel as either a floating point number, an integer or a string. The JSON-Decoder is currently only functional with 'async' sampling mode. Refer to the examples found [here](config.md).
