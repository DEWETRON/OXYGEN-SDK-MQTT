# OXYGEN MQTT-Plugin

The latest documentation can be found on GitHub Pages.

## Debug and Build the Plugin

To get started, Visual Studio Code with the following extensions can be used:

- The official C/C++ extension
- CMake Tools
- C++ TestMate to run Unit-Tests directly inside VS-Code

If you have OXYGEN installed on the default path and you start debugging, the compiled plugin gets automatically copied to the correct folder and OXYGEN is started. The Debugger will then attach to OXYGEN, allowing you to debug the plugin directly in VS-Code. To find out how this is done or how to change the default build-settings using the CMake extension, have a look at launch.json, settings.json and tasks.json.
